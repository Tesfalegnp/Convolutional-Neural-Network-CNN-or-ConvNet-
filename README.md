# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet)

This repository contains code and experiments demonstrating the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Jupyter Notebook. CNNs are a class of deep neural networks commonly used for analyzing visual imagery and are the foundation of most modern computer vision applications.

## Features

- Example implementation of CNNs in Jupyter Notebook
- Step-by-step explanations and visualizations
- Training and evaluation on sample datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, etc.)
- Customizable network architectures

## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. This project provides a hands-on introduction to CNNs, guiding users from basic concepts to building and training their own models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tesfalegnp/Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-or-ConvNet-.git
    cd Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-or-ConvNet-
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If `requirements.txt` is not present, typical dependencies include:*
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras jupyter
    ```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the notebook file (e.g., `cnn_example.ipynb`) and follow the instructions within.

3. Run the cells step-by-step to:
    - Load the dataset
    - Preprocess the data
    - Build and train the CNN model
    - Evaluate and visualize the results
